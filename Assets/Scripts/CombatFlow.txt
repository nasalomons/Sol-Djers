Basic idea of how player combat works:
- Attacking:
1. ActionableGameObject wants to attack
2. Sends Action to EventManager to attack
3. EventManger tells ONLY this ActionableGameObject when ready
3. Gets callback in OnActionEvent()
4. Sends Attack to AttackManger
5. AttackManager sends info to ALL subscribed AttackableGameObjects
6. Up to AttackableGameObjects to determine if they should take the attack in OnAttacked()

- Being attacked:
1. Enemy directly sends Attack to AttackManager (no dealing with EventManger)
2. Player receives callback in OnAttacked() and determines if it should take damage
